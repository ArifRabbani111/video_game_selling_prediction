Video Game Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict video game sales using a dataset containing game-related features such as platform, genre, publisher, and regional sales.

📊 Dataset Information

Dataset Name: game_dataset.csv

Features: Platform, Year of Release, Genre, Publisher, Sales in Different Regions

Target Variable: Global_Sales (Total sales worldwide in millions)

🚀 Steps in the Project

Import the Dataset - Load the dataset and display basic information.

Data Visualization - Correlation heatmap to analyze feature relationships.

Data Preprocessing - Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

Model Building - Implement a Linear Regression model using a pipeline.

Evaluation - Measure Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

Prediction - Compare actual vs. predicted game sales.
